## Please create an API, the topic is yours

If I were to implement an API about cars, the 5 endpoints below would need to be implemented 
* GET /cars
* GET /cars/:id
* POST /cars
* PATCH /cars/:id
* DELETE /cars/:id
  
For the cars, you have 2 options:

1. 1st option - an array in app.js const cars = [{ make: blahblah, id: 7}â€¦] You decide what is relevant (id non negotiable)
2. 
3. 2nd option, a cars.json file like in the lecture
4. 
You should at least have:

* 2 dependencies: express, cors
* 1 devDependency: nodemon
  
Please push your work to GitHub and add your API to this thread regardless of your progress by 6pm today
